## KFC In Ayodhya?
In a statement, Ayodhya district magistrate Nitish Kumar said the American fast food giant is welcome open its outlets in the town but can only sell vegetarian food items in the restricted zone where the sale and consumption of meat, fish and other non-veg items was banned by the Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath-led Uttar Pradesh government prior to the Ram Mandir ‚ÄòPran Pratishtha‚Äô ceremony last month.

The **Ayodhya district administration** has clarified its stance on **KFC** (Kentucky Fried Chicken) in the sacred temple town. While KFC is welcome to set up shop near the **Ram Temple**, there's a **catch**: the outlet must refrain from selling **non-vegetarian items** within a **15 km radius** around the temple. This restricted zone, known as the **Panch Kosi Marg**, is a pilgrimage circuit encircling the Ram Temple area. So, if KFC chooses a location outside this restricted zone, it can indeed serve its world-famous fried chicken and other non-veg delicacies¬π¬≤¬≥. üçóüå±

In summary, KFC is invited to Ayodhya, but with a **vegetarian-only menu** within the restricted area. Netizens have been buzzing about this unique condition, and it remains to be seen how KFC adapts to the temple town's culinary expectations‚Å∂. üçîüåø
